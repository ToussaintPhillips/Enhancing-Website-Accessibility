## Enhancing Website Accessibility

### Overview

As a web developer striving for accessibility compliance, the goal of this user story is to ensure that the website meets established standards. The improvements focus on providing a more accessible experience for users with diverse abilities, enhancing navigation, and understanding of the content.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. **Semantic HTML Elements:**
   - Identify non-semantic HTML elements in the code.
   - Replace non-semantic elements with appropriate semantic equivalents.
   - Verify that the structure of the page remains logical after implementing semantic HTML.

2. **Logical Structure of HTML Elements:**
   - Review the HTML structure to identify dependencies on styling or positioning.
   - Adjust HTML elements to maintain a logical structure regardless of styling.
   - Test the website to ensure that the content is comprehensible without styling.

3. **Alt Attributes for Images and Icons:**
   - Identify image and icon elements without `alt` attributes.
   - Add meaningful `alt` attributes to describe the content or purpose of each visual element.
   - Verify that assistive technologies provide relevant information based on `alt` attributes.

4. **Sequential Order of Heading Attributes:**
   - Review the heading structure in the HTML code.
   - Adjust heading attributes to follow a logical sequence (h1, h2, h3, etc.).

5. **Concise and Descriptive Title Element:**
   - Examine the current title element for conciseness and relevance.
   - Modify the title to provide a clear representation of the web page's main content or purpose.
   - Confirm that the updated title enhances the overall understanding of the web page.

### Implementation Instructions

1. **Semantic HTML Elements:**
   - Navigate to the relevant files in the codebase.
   - Identify and replace non-semantic elements with semantic equivalents (e.g., use `<nav>` for navigation).

2. **Logical Structure of HTML Elements:**
   - Examine the HTML structure and identify elements dependent on styling.
   - Adjust HTML elements to maintain a logical structure (e.g., use appropriate tags for content sections).

3. **Alt Attributes for Images and Icons:**
   - Locate image and icon elements in the code.
   - Add descriptive `alt` attributes to each visual element.

4. **Sequential Order of Heading Attributes:**
   - Review the heading structure in HTML files.
   - Adjust heading attributes to follow a logical sequence (h1, h2, h3, etc.).

5. **Concise and Descriptive Title Element:**
   - Locate the title element in the HTML head.
   - Examine and modify the title for clarity and conciseness.

### Additional Information
